# TAT-FUFP
In this study, we use a GAN-based network to predict fine-grained urban flow.

This is an easy implement of TAT_FUFP using Pytorch 1.6, tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with a RTX 3080 GPU.

Dataset
We evaluate our method on two datasets, TaxiBJ in four time periods with different proportions and BikeNYC. The sun-dataset, P6 (e.g. BikeNYC), is shown in: ├──data │ ├── P6.rar. Entire TaxiBJ dataset can be available from 'https://github.com/yoshall/UrbanFM/tree/master/data'
